Welcome to the power of Open Community Runtime (OCR) high-performance computing.

This program tests HPCG, the High Performance Conjugate Gradient (or just Conjugate Gradient)
against the OCR framework.

The Conjugate Gradient is an algorithm to solve the linear equation Ax = b for 
a matrix A that is symmetric and positive-definite, where A and b are known beforehand.
The algorithm that this program uses is from wikipedia.org, the "most commonly used algorithm."
The end result is X, with k+1. There is no preconditioner involved. The initial guess X is all
values of 1.0f. Matrix b's values are set from -10.0f to 10.0f at random.

    cgmatrix.m      Generates matrix data in ASCII files.

Instructions to setup/compile:
	1. Install the make tools and OCR dependencies for your appropriate Linux distribution.
    2. Install OCR. After installing OCR, make sure OCR_CONFIG and OCR_INSTALL are defined.
    3. make clean; make compile. If you get errors, go to step 1.
    4. Install Octave or Matlab.
    5. Open cgmatrix.m with your favorite text editor. Configure the parameters to your liking.
    6. Use Octave or Matlab to run the cgmatrix.m script. This will output a matrix data ASCII file.
       Example: octave ./cgmatrix.m
 
Running the program:
	./hpcg.exe -ocr:cfg ${OCR_CONFIG} isSparse datafile.mat n
	${OCR_CONFIG}: The path to your OCR configuration file. Do not use quotes.
    isSparse: Whether A is to be treated as a sparse matrix. Must be an integer.
	          If isSparse is 0: Matrix is treated as a dense matrix
              If isSparse is 1: Matrix is treated as a sparse matrix
    datafile.mat: Your ASCII file of matrix data is passed in here as a filename. Do not use quotes.
    n: The size (in rows) of your matrix data file. Must be an integer greater than 0.

    Example: ./hpcg.exe -ocr:cfg /home/foobar/ocr/install/x86-pthread-x86 0 cg500.mat 500
