To make all files:
	make all 

To make specific files: 
	make <file_name.o>
	ex: make serial_stream.o

options.h:
	Contains getopt parsing for *_stream.c files

parallel_db_edt_breakdown_stream.c:

parallel_edt_breakdown_stream.c:

parallel_db_breakdown_stream.c:

parallel_stream.c:
	-- Simple parallel implementation of stream in OCR.
	-- Datablock are divided implicitly via indexing set by "split"
	-- Each instance of pipelineEDT operates on db_size / split number of elements
	-- All vector operations are run in a single edt (pipelineEDT) similar to serial_stream.c
	   with the difference being that there will be "split" instances of pipelineEDT each
	   operating on db_size / split.

serial_stream.c:
	-- Serial implementation of stream in OCR.
	-- Vector operations are run in the following order: 
	   COPY --> SCALE --> ADD --> TRIAD
