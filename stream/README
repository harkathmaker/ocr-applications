** Overview of Files **
***********************
generate_results.py:
	-- Generates results and graphs for serial and parallel stream versions

options.h:
	-- Contains getopt parsing for *_stream.c files

parallel_db_edt_breakdown_stream.c:

parallel_db_breakdown_stream.c:

parallel_stream.c:
	-- Simple parallel implementation of stream in OCR.
	-- Datablock are divided implicitly via indexing set by "split"
	-- Each instance of pipelineEDT operates on db_size / split number of elements
	-- All vector operations are run in a single edt (pipelineEDT) similar to serial_stream.c
	   with the difference being that there will be "split" instances of pipelineEDT each
	   operating on db_size / split.

serial_edt_breakdown_stream.c:
	-- Breaks apart vector operations (COPY, SCALE, ADD, TRIAD) into 
	   separate EDTs

serial_stream.c:
	-- Serial implementation of stream in OCR.
	-- Vector operations are run in a single EDT (iterEdt) in the following order: 
	   COPY --> SCALE --> ADD --> TRIAD

- e | --export CSV files:
	Timing data is reported in the following format:
	Tria1 1, Trial 2, Trial 3, ... , Trial N, Average of N Trials
